the daughter of Hilkiah,\nthe wife of Joakim.”\nWhen she was sent for,\nshe came with her parents, children and all her relatives.\nAll her relatives and the onlookers were weeping.\nIn the midst of the people the two elders rose up\nand laid their hands on her head.\nThrough tears she looked up to heaven,\nfor she trusted in the Lord wholeheartedly.\nThe elders made this accusation:\n“As we were walking in the garden alone,\nthis woman entered with two girls\nand shut the doors of the garden, dismissing the girls.\nA young man, who was hidden there, came and lay with her.\nWhen we, in a corner of the garden, saw this crime,\nwe ran toward them.\nWe saw them lying together,\nbut the man we could not hold, because he was stronger than we;\nhe opened the doors and ran off.\nThen we seized her and asked who the young man was,\nbut she refused to tell us.\nWe testify to this.”\nThe assembly believed them,\nsince they were elders and judges of the people,\nand they condemned her to death.\nBut Susanna cried aloud:\n“O eternal God, you know what is hidden\nand are aware of all things before they come to be:\nyou know that they have testified falsely against me.\nHere I am about to die,\nthough I have done none of the things\nwith which these wicked men have charged me.”\nThe Lord heard her prayer.\nAs she was being led to execution,\nGod stirred up the holy spirit of a young boy named Daniel,\nand he cried aloud:\n“I will have no part in the death of this woman.”\nAll the people turned and asked him, “What is this you are saying?”\nHe stood in their midst and continued,\n“Are you such fools, O children of Israel!\nTo condemn a woman of Israel without examination\nand without clear evidence?\nReturn to court, for they have testified falsely against her.”\nThen all the people returned in haste.\nTo Daniel the elders said,\n“Come, sit with us and inform us,\nsince God has given you the prestige of old age.”\nBut he replied,\n“Separate these two far from each other that I may examine them.”\nAfter they were separated one from the other,\nhe called one of them and said:\n“How you have grown evil with age!\nNow have your past sins come to term:\npassing unjust sentences, condemning the innocent,\nand freeing the guilty, although the Lord says,\n‘The innocent and the just you shall not put to death.’\nNow, then, if you were a witness,\ntell me under what tree you saw them together.”\n“Under a mastic tree,” he answered.\nDaniel replied, “Your fine lie has cost you your head,\nfor the angel of God shall receive the sentence from him\nand split you in two.”\nPutting him to one side, he ordered the other one to be brought.\nDaniel said to him,\n“Offspring of Canaan, not of Judah, beauty has seduced you,\nlust has subverted your conscience.\nThis is how you acted with the daughters of Israel,\nand in their fear they yielded to you;\nbut a daughter of Judah did not tolerate your wickedness.\nNow, then, tell me under what tree you surprised them together.”\n“Under an oak,” he said.\nDaniel replied, “Your fine lie has cost you also your head,\nfor the angel of God waits with a sword to cut you in two\nso as to make an end of you both.”\nThe whole assembly cried aloud,\nblessing God who saves those who hope in him.\nThey rose up against the two elders,\nfor by their own words Daniel had convicted them of perjury.\nAccording to the law of Moses,\nthey inflicted on them\nthe penalty they had plotted to impose on their neighbor:\nthey put them to death.\nThus was innocent blood spared that day.\nOR:\nThe

    "text": "When the hour came,\nJesus took his place at table with the apostles.\nHe said to them,\n\"I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,\nfor, I tell you, I shall not eat it again\nuntil there is fulfillment in the kingdom of God.\"\nThen he took a cup, gave thanks, and said,\n\"Take this and share it among yourselves;\nfor I tell you that from this time on\nI shall not drink of the fruit of the vine\nuntil the kingdom of God comes.\"\nThen he took the bread, said the blessing,\nbroke it, and gave it to them, saying,\n\"This is my body, which will be given for you;\ndo this in memory of me.\"\nAnd likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying,\n\"This cup is the new covenant in my blood,\nwhich will be shed for you.\n\"And yet behold, the hand of the one who is to betray me\nis with me on the table;\nfor the Son of Man indeed goes as it has been determined;\nbut woe to that man by whom he is betrayed.\"\nAnd they began to debate among themselves\nwho among them would do such a deed.\nThen an argument broke out among them\nabout which of them should be regarded as the greatest.\nHe said to them,\n\"The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them\nand those in authority over them are addressed as 'Benefactors';\nbut among you it shall not be so.\nRather, let the greatest among you be as the youngest,\nand the leader as the servant.\nFor who is greater:\nthe one seated at table or the one who serves?\nIs it not the one seated at table?\nI am among you as the one who serves.\nIt is you who have stood by me in my trials;\nand I confer a kingdom on you,\njust as my Father has conferred one on me,\nthat you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom;\nand you will sit on thrones\njudging the twelve tribes of Israel.\n\"Simon, Simon, behold Satan has demanded\nto sift all of you like wheat,\nbut I have prayed that your own faith may not fail;\nand once you have turned back,\nyou must strengthen your brothers.\"\nHe said to him,\n\"Lord, I am prepared to go to prison and to die with you.\"\nBut he replied,\n\"I tell you, Peter, before the cock crows this day,\nyou will deny three times that you know me.\"\nHe said to them,\n\"When I sent you forth without a money bag or a sack or sandals,\nwere you in need of anything?\"\n\"No, nothing, \" they replied.\nHe said to them,\n\"But now one who has a money bag should take it,\nand likewise a sack,\nand one who does not have a sword\nshould sell his cloak and buy one.\nFor I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me,\nnamely,\nHe was counted among the wicked;\nand indeed what is written about me is coming to fulfillment.\"\nThen they said,\n\"Lord, look, there are two swords here.\"\nBut he replied, \"It is enough!\"\nThen going out, he went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives,\nand the disciples followed him.\nWhen he arrived at the place he said to them,\n\"Pray that you may not undergo the test.\"\nAfter withdrawing about a stone's throw from them and kneeling,\nhe prayed, saying, \"Father, if you are willing,\ntake this cup away from me;\nstill, not my will but yours be done.\"\nAnd to strengthen him an angel from heaven appeared to him.\nHe was in such agony and he prayed so fervently\nthat his sweat became like drops of blood\nfalling on the ground.\nWhen he rose from prayer and returned to his disciples,\nhe found them sleeping from grief.\nHe said to them, \"Why are you sleeping?\nGet up and pray that you may not undergo the test.\"\nWhile he was still speaking, a crowd approached\nand in front was one of the Twelve, a man named Judas.\nHe went up to Jesus to kiss him.\nJesus said to him,\n\"Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?\"\nHis disciples realized what was about to happen, and they asked,\n\"Lord, shall we strike with a sword?\"\nAnd one of them struck the high priest's servant\nand cut off his right ear.\nBut Jesus said in reply,\n\"Stop, no more of this!\"\nThen he touched the servant's ear and healed him.\nAnd Jesus said to the chief priests and temple guards\nand elders who had come for him,\n\"Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?\nDay after day I was with you in the temple area,\nand you did not seize me;\nbut this is your hour, the time for the power of darkness.\"\nAfter arresting him they led him away\nand took him into the house of the high priest;\nPeter was following at a distance.\nThey lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it,\nand Peter sat down with them.\nWhen a maid saw him seated in the light,\nshe looked intently at him and said,\n\"This man too was with him.\"\nBut he denied it saying,\n\"Woman, I do not know him.\"\nA short while later someone else saw him and said,\n\"You too are one of them\";\nbut Peter answered, \"My friend, I am not.\"\nAbout an hour later, still another insisted,\n\"Assuredly, this man too was with him,\nfor he also is a Galilean.\"\nBut Peter said,\n\"My friend, I do not know what you are talking about.\"\nJust as he was saying this, the cock crowed,\nand the Lord turned and looked at Peter;\nand Peter remembered the word of the Lord,\nhow he had said to him,\n\"Before the cock crows today, you will deny me three times.\"\nHe went out and began to weep bitterly.\nThe men who held Jesus in custody were ridiculing and beating him.\nThey blindfolded him and questioned him, saying,\n\"Prophesy!  Who is it that struck you?\"\nAnd they reviled him in saying many other things against him.\nWhen day came the council of elders of the people met,\nboth chief priests and scribes,\nand they brought him before their Sanhedrin.\nThey said, \"If you are the Christ, tell us, \"\nbut he replied to them, \"If I tell you, you will not believe,\nand if I question, you will not respond.\nBut from this time on the Son of Man will be seated\nat the right hand of the power of God.\"\nThey all asked, \"Are you then the Son of God?\"\nHe replied to them, \"You say that I am.\"\nThen they said, \"What further need have we for testimony?\nWe have heard it from his own mouth.\"\nThen the whole assembly of them arose and brought him before Pilate.\nThey brought charges against him, saying,\n\"We found this man misleading our people;\nhe opposes the payment of taxes to Caesar\nand maintains that he is the Christ, a king.\"\nPilate asked him, \"Are you the king of the Jews?\"\nHe said to him in reply, \"You say so.\"\nPilate then addressed the chief priests and the crowds,\n\"I find this man not guilty.\"\nBut they were adamant and said,\n\"He is inciting the people with his teaching throughout all Judea,\nfrom Galilee where he began even to here.\"\nOn hearing this Pilate asked if the man was a Galilean;\nand upon learning that he was under Herod's jurisdiction,\nhe sent him to Herod who was in Jerusalem at that time.\nHerod was very glad to see Jesus;\nhe had been wanting to see him for a long time,\nfor he had heard about him\nand had been hoping to see him perform some sign.\nHe questioned him at length,\nbut he gave him no answer.\nThe chief priests and scribes, meanwhile,\nstood by accusing him harshly.\nHerod and his soldiers treated him contemptuously and mocked him,\nand after clothing him in resplendent garb,\nhe sent him back to Pilate.\nHerod and Pilate became friends that very day,\neven though they had been enemies formerly.\nPilate then summoned the chief priests, the rulers, and the people\nand said to them, \"You brought this man to me\nand accused him of inciting the people to revolt.\nI have conducted my investigation in your presence\nand have not found this man guilty\nof the charges you have brought against him,\nnor did Herod, for he sent him back to us.\nSo no capital crime has been committed by him.\nTherefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"\nBut all together they shouted out,\n\"Away with this man!\nRelease Barabbas to us.\"\n— Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for a rebellion\nthat had taken place in the city and for murder. —\nAgain Pilate addressed them, still wishing to release Jesus,\nbut they continued their shouting,\n\"Crucify him!  Crucify him!\"\nPilate addressed them a third time,\n\"What evil has this man done?\nI found him guilty of no capital crime.\nTherefore I shall have him flogged and then release him.\"\nWith loud shouts, however,\nthey persisted in calling for his crucifixion,\nand their voices prevailed.\nThe verdict of Pilate was that their demand should be granted.\nSo he released the man who had been imprisoned\nfor rebellion and murder, for whom they asked,\nand he handed Jesus over to them to deal with as they wished.\nAs they led him away\nthey took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian,\nwho was coming in from the country;\nand after laying the cross on him,\nthey made him carry it behind Jesus.\nA large crowd of people followed Jesus,\nincluding many women who mourned and lamented him.\nJesus turned to them and said,\n\"Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me;\nweep instead for yourselves and for your children\nfor indeed, the days are coming when people will say,\n'Blessed are the barren,\nthe wombs that never bore\nand the breasts that never nursed.'\nAt that time people will say to the mountains,\n'Fall upon us!'\nand to the hills, 'Cover us!'\nfor if these things are done when the wood is green\nwhat will happen when it is dry?\"\nNow two others, both criminals,\nwere led away with him to be executed.\nWhen they came to the place called the Skull,\nthey crucified him and the criminals there,\none on his right, the other on his left.\nThen Jesus said,\n\"Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.\"\nThey divided his garments by casting lots.\nThe people stood by and watched;\nthe rulers, meanwhile, sneered at him and said,\n\"He saved others, let him save himself\nif he is the chosen one, the Christ of God.\"\nEven the soldiers jeered at him.\nAs they approached to offer him wine they called out,\n\"If you are King of the Jews, save yourself.\"\nAbove him there was an inscription that read,\n\"This is the King of the Jews.\"\nNow one of the criminals hanging there reviled Jesus, saying,\n\"Are you not the Christ?\nSave yourself and us.\"\nThe other, however, rebuking him, said in reply,\n\"Have you no fear of God,\nfor you are subject to the same condemnation?\nAnd indeed, we have been condemned justly,\nfor the sentence we received corresponds to our crimes,\nbut this man has done nothing criminal.\"\nThen he said,\n\"Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.\"\nHe replied to him,\n\"Amen, I say to you,\ntoday you will be with me in Paradise.\"\nIt was now about noon and darkness came over the whole land\nuntil three in the afternoon\nbecause of an eclipse of the sun.\nThen the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.\nJesus cried out in a loud voice,\n\"Father, into your hands I commend my spirit\";\nand when he had said this he breathed his last.\nHere all kneel and pause for a short time.\nThe centurion who witnessed what had happened glorified God and said,\n\"This man was innocent beyond doubt.\"\nWhen all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened,\nthey returned home beating their breasts;\nbut all his acquaintances stood at a distance,\nincluding the women who had followed him from Galilee\nand saw these events.\nNow there was a virtuous and righteous man named Joseph who,\nthough he was a member of the council,\nhad not consented to their plan of action.\nHe came from the Jewish town of Arimathea\nand was awaiting the kingdom of God.\nHe went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.\nAfter he had taken the body down,\nhe wrapped it in a linen cloth\nand laid him in a rock-hewn tomb\nin which no one had yet been buried.\nIt was the day of preparation,\nand the sabbath was about to begin.\nThe women who had come from Galilee with him followed behind,\nand when they had seen the tomb\nand the way in which his body was laid in it,\nthey returned and prepared spices and perfumed oils.\nThen they rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.",

    "text": "Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley\nto where there was a garden,\ninto which he and his disciples entered.\nJudas his betrayer also knew the place,\nbecause Jesus had often met there with his disciples.\nSo Judas got a band of soldiers and guards\nfrom the chief priests and the Pharisees\nand went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.\nJesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him,\nwent out and said to them, “Whom are you looking for?”\nThey answered him, “Jesus the Nazorean.”\nHe said to them, “I AM.”\nJudas his betrayer was also with them.\nWhen he said to them, “I AM, “\nthey turned away and fell to the ground.\nSo he again asked them,\n“Whom are you looking for?”\nThey said, “Jesus the Nazorean.”\nJesus answered,\n“I told you that I AM.\nSo if you are looking for me, let these men go.”\nThis was to fulfill what he had said,\n“I have not lost any of those you gave me.”\nThen Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it,\nstruck the high priest’s slave, and cut off his right ear.\nThe slave’s name was Malchus.\nJesus said to Peter,\n“Put your sword into its scabbard.\nShall I not drink the cup that the Father gave me?”\nSo the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus,\nbound him, and brought him to Annas first.\nHe was the father-in-law of Caiaphas,\nwho was high priest that year.\nIt was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews\nthat it was better that one man should die rather than the people.\nSimon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus.\nNow the other disciple was known to the high priest,\nand he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus.\nBut Peter stood at the gate outside.\nSo the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest,\nwent out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.\nThen the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter,\n“You are not one of this man’s disciples, are you?”\nHe said, “I am not.”\nNow the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire\nthat they had made, because it was cold,\nand were warming themselves.\nPeter was also standing there keeping warm.\nThe high priest questioned Jesus\nabout his disciples and about his doctrine.\nJesus answered him,\n“I have spoken publicly to the world.\nI have always taught in a synagogue\nor in the temple area where all the Jews gather,\nand in secret I have said nothing.  Why ask me?\nAsk those who heard me what I said to them.\nThey know what I said.”\nWhen he had said this,\none of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said,\n“Is this the way you answer the high priest?”\nJesus answered him,\n“If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong;\nbut if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?”\nThen Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.\nNow Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm.\nAnd they said to him,\n“You are not one of his disciples, are you?”\nHe denied it and said,\n“I am not.”\nOne of the slaves of the high priest,\na relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said,\n“Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?”\nAgain Peter denied it.\nAnd immediately the cock crowed.\nThen they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium.\nIt was morning.\nAnd they themselves did not enter the praetorium,\nin order not to be defiled so that they could eat the Passover.\nSo Pilate came out to them and said,\n“What charge do you bring against this man?”\nThey answered and said to him,\n“If he were not a criminal,\nwe would not have handed him over to you.”\nAt this, Pilate said to them,\n“Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.”\nThe Jews answered him,\n“We do not have the right to execute anyone, “\nin order that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled\nthat he said indicating the kind of death he would die.\nSo Pilate went back into the praetorium\nand summoned Jesus and said to him,\n“Are you the King of the Jews?”\nJesus answered,\n“Do you say this on your own\nor have others told you about me?”\nPilate answered,\n“I am not a Jew, am I?\nYour own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me.\nWhat have you done?”\nJesus answered,\n“My kingdom does not belong to this world.\nIf my kingdom did belong to this world,\nmy attendants would be fighting\nto keep me from being handed over to the Jews.\nBut as it is, my kingdom is not here.”\nSo Pilate said to him,\n“Then you are a king?”\nJesus answered,\n“You say I am a king.\nFor this I was born and for this I came into the world,\nto testify to the truth.\nEveryone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”\nPilate said to him, “What is truth?”\nWhen he had said this,\nhe again went out to the Jews and said to them,\n“I find no guilt in him.\nBut you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover.\nDo you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”\nThey cried out again,\n“Not this one but Barabbas!”\nNow Barabbas was a revolutionary.\nThen Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.\nAnd the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head,\nand clothed him in a purple cloak,\nand they came to him and said,\n“Hail, King of the Jews!”\nAnd they struck him repeatedly.\nOnce more Pilate went out and said to them,\n“Look, I am bringing him out to you,\nso that you may know that I find no guilt in him.”\nSo Jesus came out,\nwearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak.\nAnd he said to them, “Behold, the man!”\nWhen the chief priests and the guards saw him they cried out,\n“Crucify him, crucify him!”\nPilate said to them,\n“Take him yourselves and crucify him.\nI find no guilt in him.”\nThe Jews answered,\n“We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die,\nbecause he made himself the Son of God.”\nNow when Pilate heard this statement,\nhe became even more afraid,\nand went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus,\n“Where are you from?”\nJesus did not answer him.\nSo Pilate said to him,\n“Do you not speak to me?\nDo you not know that I have power to release you\nand I have power to crucify you?”\nJesus answered him,\n“You would have no power over me\nif it had not been given to you from above.\nFor this reason the one who handed me over to you\nhas the greater sin.”\nConsequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the Jews cried out,\n“If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar.\nEveryone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.”\nWhen Pilate heard these words he brought Jesus out\nand seated him on the judge’s bench\nin the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.\nIt was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon.\nAnd he said to the Jews,\n“Behold, your king!”\nThey cried out,\n“Take him away, take him away!  Crucify him!”\nPilate said to them,\n“Shall I crucify your king?”\nThe chief priests answered,\n“We have no king but Caesar.”\nThen he handed him over to them to be crucified.\nSo they took Jesus, and, carrying the cross himself,\nhe went out to what is called the Place of the Skull,\nin Hebrew, Golgotha.\nThere they crucified him, and with him two others,\none on either side, with Jesus in the middle.\nPilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross.\nIt read,\n“Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.”\nNow many of the Jews read this inscription,\nbecause the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city;\nand it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.\nSo the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate,\n“Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’\nbut that he said, ‘I am the King of the Jews’.”\nPilate answered,\n“What I have written, I have written.”\nWhen the soldiers had crucified Jesus,\nthey took his clothes and divided them into four shares,\na share for each soldier.\nThey also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless,\nwoven in one piece from the top down.\nSo they said to one another,\n“Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be, “\nin order that the passage of Scripture might be fulfilled that says:\nThey divided my garments among them,\nand for my vesture they cast lots.\nThis is what the soldiers did.\nStanding by the cross of Jesus were his mother\nand his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,\nand Mary of Magdala.\nWhen Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved\nhe said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son.”\nThen he said to the disciple,\n“Behold, your mother.”\nAnd from that hour the disciple took her into his home.\nAfter this, aware that everything was now finished,\nin order that the Scripture might be fulfilled,\nJesus said, “I thirst.”\nThere was a vessel filled with common wine.\nSo they put a sponge soaked in wine on a sprig of hyssop\nand put it up to his mouth.\nWhen Jesus had taken the wine, he said,\n“It is finished.”\nAnd bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.\nHere all kneel and pause for a short time.\nNow since it was preparation day,\nin order that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath,\nfor the sabbath day of that week was a solemn one,\nthe Jews asked Pilate that their legs be broken\nand that they be taken down.\nSo the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first\nand then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.\nBut when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead,\nthey did not break his legs,\nbut one soldier thrust his lance into his side,\nand immediately blood and water flowed out.\nAn eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true;\nhe knows that he is speaking the truth,\nso that you also may come to believe.\nFor this happened so that the Scripture passage might be fulfilled:\nNot a bone of it will be broken.\nAnd again another passage says:\nThey will look upon him whom they have pierced.\nAfter this, Joseph of Arimathea,\nsecretly a disciple of Jesus for fear of the Jews,\nasked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus.\nAnd Pilate permitted it.\nSo he came and took his body.\nNicodemus, the one who had first come to him at night,\nalso came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes\nweighing about one hundred pounds.\nThey took the body of Jesus\nand bound it with burial cloths along with the spices,\naccording to the Jewish burial custom.\nNow in the place where he had been crucified there was a garden,\nand in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.\nSo they laid Jesus there because of the Jewish preparation day;\nfor the tomb was close by.",
